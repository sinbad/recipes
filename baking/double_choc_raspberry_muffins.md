# Double Chocolate Rasperry Muffins

One of my favourites, and ideal if like me you're a dark chocolate lover.
The combination of the richness of the dark chocolate and coffee, the
sharpness of the raspberries, and the copious amounts of sugar to balance it
is bang-on in my view. But I would say that since this is one of my creations ðŸ™‚

Servings: 8

40g Cocoa powder
